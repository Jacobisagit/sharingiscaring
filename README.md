The Cause? 

My chosen cause is to improve the way we donate and give to charities the idea is to educate people on how their money is being used in the charity industry. and how opting for this new innovative refreshing concept of donating would completely change the way charities work. saving millions in overhead by.

My Target Auidence?

The concept is aimed at all ages as a single pound can purchase two hundred grams of seeds, so people can donate pennies and still make a huge controbution that will only grown and become an investment for the chosen village allowing them to develope and grown their own economy. 

Reaction?

Ideally i would like my audience to be shocked at the number of cases of curroption in charities and the huge amount the industry is worth and the vast amount of the donations that actually just go to paying overheads and large pay checks. as well as this simultaniously I am trying to educate my audience on the benifits of hemp seeds as a alternative to your conventional donation.

Call to action? 

I would like to pursaude my audience into avoiding convential charities and to promote and educate the benifits of hemp, to really give the user a greater understanding of the topic and ideally give a miniscule amount of money to purchase some seeds which will help prospure and benifit someones life who is in need.

Symbols?
to try to get my point across in the most effective way possible I will aim to use graphs and statistics and imagery to convey the concept of my idea and to help these vital facts come across clearly which will alow the user to absorb and take in all the relevent key information which will only educate the audience, to really have a grasp on the movement and concept.

Debate?
to allow people to voice their own oppinions or maybe to clarify something they dont fully understand i could have a chat section on the site which allows people to hear from others on what their outlook on the concept is. this could encourage people to become a donater if other people are saying it is successful. this could also add constructive critism that could further benifit the idea and movement.

Content?
I have spent hours reading through countless stories of charity curroption and how much money the industry is really worth and how donations are being used for other agendas. it is easy to see a fresh change is needed. also i have been reading alot about the benifits of hemp and how easily grown it is in any conditions in the world in a 12 week cycle aswell as finding so much information on hemp that you know your average person is not aware of that would completely alter someones outlook and impression of hemp.I have also looked at charity websites to try to gain an understand of how their system runs and take any pros and cons I could and adapt it to my work, for example I felt having donation boxes popping up everywhere on the page felt like you were being forced and preasured into donating rather than being pursaded and feeling passionate on why you giving your money.

Story?
The story my page tells is one of an outdated broken donations system we currently live in and how a new cost effective efficent concept could completely change the way we donate, with the help of educating my audience through out their journey on the site they should leave with a good knowledge and understanding of the benifits of hemp and the downfalls of the current large charity corporations making millions on donations.

Wireframe idea's?
For my frames I have tried to go with a really simple basic layout the idea is to have images of each town that you can donate to and when you hover over the image it will slide up tell you how many plants have been grown and information on the village and what the people can use it for aswell as a donate button which will allow you to purchase seeds from 1p onwards. inbetween the villages i thought i could have facts and information fadding in an out which will help the user absorb the vital facts and information on the topic.
